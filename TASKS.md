- [x] Update the README.md file outlining the tech stack used to create this application.
- [x] Generate test cases covering everything in project.md including the baseline of how a typical to do list application should work given the features provided.
    - [x] Rejected: You created an md file with the test cases. You were supposed to actually make unit tests that can be run. They should all fail at the start so that we can continue with TBD tasks to pass them.

- [x] For data persistence, let's use Supabase as the BaaS. This will enable cross-device sync while working with GitHub Pages. Users will need to sign in with email/password or social auth.
- [ ] The error message when someone tries to make a task without signing in is great, but we should briefly explain why, which is essentially that we store tasks in Supabase. Logging into github allows users to login and see their tasks from any computer.
