Note when the human rejects a task, he will uncheck a task and create a subtask below it with a rejection reason. Mark off all subtasks before re-marking the parent task as complete.

- [x] Let's add a footer to the bottom of the page that is horizontally centered. For now it will have a link "Made by Adam" that links to adamgrant.info
- [x] When not logged in, we should have some example tasks that appear. So these won't actually exist in supabase, it's just meant to show what it would look like for someone who has been using it for a while. Below is the example data in order showing the completion status ("x" or " "), title, and lifetime value.

1. "x", Fix toaster, 0d
2. " ", Call Mom, 0d
3. " ", Set up dentist appointment, 1d
4. " ", Clean keyboard, 2d
5. " ", Get vanity license plate, 3d
6. "x", Air in tires, 4d
7. " ", Organize toothbrushes, 4d
8. " ", Clean up attic, 4d

- [x] The delete button is too visible. Can we style the button so it has a transparent background and border and have the text underlined and Grey?
    - [x] Rejected: Still has a border.
- [x] When I create a new task, it should be selected and loaded into the detail view after it is populated in the list.
- [x] The application works correctly when I login to github when running on localhost, but when I have it published to GH pages https://adamjgrant.github.io/tides-over-sand/ it redirects to a localhost address.
- [x] If I delete a task, once it is deleted and goes away from the interface, automatically select the first item in the task list and show its detail if there are any tasks remaining.
- [x] For the max-width 768px breakpoint, I want the task detail to open in a modal instead.
- [x] Under the mobile breakpoint, the task list does not scroll.
- [x] Under the mobile breakpoint, the add new task UI is overflowed out of view. It should be docked to the bottom.
- [x] Let's bring in an icon library so we can use richer icons instead of existing emojis.
- [x] When not logged in, The "sign in with github" button should look like a link preceded by a github logo and it should replace the "add task" and "+" button elements.
    - [x] Rejected: make sure the old "Sign in with github" button at the top of the page is no longer there.
- [x] New feature. If the url has `?appmode=1`, we show .content-split full screen, popped out of the HTML. The idea is I can save this to my home screen and make it look like a real app on my phone, without all the stuff around it like the title and body copy.
    - [x] Rejected: We need to make sure in the sign in with github flow that if we already have ?appmode=1 that it persists on the redirect.
- [x] Only above the mobile breakpoint and only when the task detail is open, limit the width of the task list container to about 400px, allowing the active task detail panel to occupy the remaining width.
    - [x] Rejected On non mobile in app mode, the task list is not limited by 400px width.
    - [x] Rejected: The task list is good now but the task detail doesn't fill the remaining horizontal space.
- [x] Only when in appmode=1, We should have a thin title bar at the top of the task list with a bold text "Tides over Sand" on the left and on the right we should see "Sign out" which only appears when signed in. It will not say to sign in there when signed out.
    - [x] Rejected: When in appmode and signed out, the "Sign out" button is not there. However, if I sign in, then sign out again, it stays there.
- [x] I want a similar button styled exactly the same way to the left of the sign out button that appears only in appmode but this one is "Exit app mode" and it redirects to `/` without the url params.
- [x] Just below .content-split, I want a simple link in #AAAAAA font color that says "Enter app mode" which will redirect to `/?appmode=1`
- [x] There are way too many `!important;`s in the CSS. This points to bad programming. Please review.
- [x] On mobile in appmode, The "Add new task" does not appear docked at the bottom. This might be because .task-list-container does not occupy the full vertical viewport either.
- [x] If the page opens and we are in app mode, and we're not under the mobile breakpoint, autoselect the first task.
- [x] When exiting app mode, it takes us to `/`. Instead let's have it redirect to whatever the current URL is minus url params.
- [x] Right now we display none things when in app mode. Let's also display none anything in body div.app that is not main.main-content.
