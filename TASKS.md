AI Agents: Do not edit this file except to mark or unmark items as complete.
AI Agents: Do not proceed unless you have already read PROJECT.md.
Note when the human rejects a task, he will uncheck a task and create a subtask below it with a rejection reason. Mark off all subtasks before re-marking the parent task as complete.

- [x] Update the README.md file outlining the tech stack used to create this application.
- [x] Generate test cases covering everything in project.md including the baseline of how a typical to do list application should work given the features provided.
    - [x] Rejected: You created an md file with the test cases. You were supposed to actually make unit tests that can be run. They should all fail at the start so that we can continue with TBD tasks to pass them.
- [x] See AGENTS.md to understand how the diagnosis folder should be used. It looks like you have files there that are meant to live on indefinitely.
- [x] For data persistence, let's use Supabase as the BaaS. This will enable cross-device sync while working with GitHub Pages. Users will need to sign in with email/password or social auth.
- [ ] The error message when someone tries to make a task without signing in is great, but we should briefly explain why, which is essentially that we store tasks in Supabase. Logging into github allows users to login and see their tasks from any computer.
- [ ] Review PROJECT.md for requirements. Currently the task row shows UI for the lifetime but it shouldn't.
- [ ] The moment a task is created, its lifetime should be 0d because that's how old it is. The oldest a task can be is 4d because at 5d, it is permanently deleted.
    - [ ] Make sure this logic deletes it from supabase too.
    - [ ] Currently, tasks start at 5d.
- [ ] Let's make the header area much smaller. The title should be a smaller font but still heading-like. Let's also lose the subtitle.
- [ ] Below the task UI, add a "What is this about?" section that explains the philosophy and how to use the app in three short paragraphs.
- [ ] I want the tasks to open as a right side split next to the task list, not as a modal.
